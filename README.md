# Crypto Tracker

**Crypto Tracker** was built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js** and **TypeScript**: for a solid, modern, and maintainable foundation, facilitating the development of high-performance and secure websites, while ensuring type safety and developer productivity.

- **MongoDB**: for a scalable and flexible NoSQL database solution, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data, and providing powerful querying and indexing capabilities to support the application's data needs.

- **Storybook**: for developing and testing UI components in isolation, ensuring consistency and quality across the application by creating a central hub for reusable components.

- **TailwindCSS**: for rapid, clean, and customized design using utility classes, allowing great styling flexibility without writing custom CSS, and enabling seamless theme support for dark and light modes.

- **Shadcn UI**: for prebuilt, accessible, and customizable UI components, accelerating development while maintaining design consistency.

- **Chart.js**: for integrating highly customizable and interactive charts, providing users with clear and visually compelling data visualizations.

- **Lucide Icons**: for modern and dynamic vector icons, providing a professional visual touch that is easily customizable and responsive to the application's theme.

- **next-themes**: for effortless theme switching (light/dark mode), enhancing user experience and visual accessibility.

This combination of tools allows for the creation of a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface, while ensuring a clean and easily maintainable code structure. By leveraging these technologies, **Crypto Tracker** delivers an optimal balance between performance, design, and user-centric functionality.
